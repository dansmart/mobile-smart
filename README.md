About the plugin
----------------
Mobile Smart (http://www.mobile-smart.co.uk/), using detection from the MobileESP project (http://www.mobileesp.com) allows the following:

* Switch your theme to a mobile-ready theme if a mobile device is detected (you can now enable/disable iPad/tablets)
* Manual Switcher - to allow your user to manually switch between desktop and mobile versions. Available in 3 versions: widget, option to automatically insert into footer, or template tag.
* Template functions to help determine which tier of mobile device (touch/smartphone/other) is viewing your site, to allow conditional content inclusion.
* Adds device and tier specific CSS selectors to the body_class, to allow conditional CSS (e.g. so in the same way you have ".single" that you can target ".iphone" or ".mobile-tier-touch".)
* Image transcoding - rescale images to fit their device (experimental - uses TimThumb) note: I may well remove this soon due to security risks of TimThumb

Check out the [Mobile Smart Pro plugin](http://www.mobile-smart.co.uk) for support for:
* Domain switching - use a mobile theme to detect mobile devices, and redirect to appropriate theme URL (e.g. m.yoursite.com)
* Mobile Pages - mobile versions of posts and pages with the same URL
* Mobile Menus - mobile versions of menus for mobile-specific navigation
* Hide selected widgets on mobile devices
* Disable selected plugins on mobile devices

See the Frequently Asked Questions for guidance on how to use the plugin.

Device support includes iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone 6 & 7, 8, Symbian, and many more.
